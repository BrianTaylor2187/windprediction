# A few naive models on wind prediction
Data taken from ACIS for Jan 1 2017 to Jan 1 2019 for Keoma AGCM weather station.

Wind Models tries to predict the wind speed from that day's other weather data.

Tomorrow's Wind tries to predict the wind speed for the next day on the previous day's wind speed.

None of the models take into account things like wind direction.
